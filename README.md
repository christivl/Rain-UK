## This Project
This is a personal project, displaying my current skills in data science. The main focus is on working with databases, statistical analysis and data visualisation.
The project is made of three mini-projects, each in the form of a Jupyter Notebook:

1. Curve Fitting:

This notebook retrieves the historical rainfall data for London from 1980 from a publicly available API (OpenMeteo). It then calculates the number of rainy days per year and plots the yearly rain count. Finally, the trends are modelled using a third-order Fourier series.

2. Automation:

This notebook automates the calculation of rainy days per year across hundreds of UK cities. However, it also scrapes It begins by scraping the geographical coordinates (Latitude, Longitude) of these cities, from the GeoNames public database, as these are required inputs for the API.



3. Colourmaps & Animated Plots




## Why the weather
The most popular small talk topic in the UK is the weather! "Is it going to rain today?" or "Will we have a sunny weekend?" and similar questions are part of a conversation, almost every day!

The common interest in the weather motivated me to start this personal project, along with the fact that there are plenty 
of weather databases and many of them are free-access.




## Usage
All the Jupyter notebooks can be viewed as "static" files on GitHub. However, there is also the possibility of viewing each of them interactively and running them locally on Google Colab, using the following links:

The text files and the plots produced by the three scripts can also be found in this branch.

## List of files:

### Jupyter Notebooks

1. Curve_Fitting_London_Rain.ipynb
2. Automation.ipynb
3. Colourmaps_and_animated_plots.ipynb

### Text files

1. rain_AVG_city.txt:

Text file containing the data needed for the 3rd Notebook (Colourmaps and animated plots).
It contains the number of rainy days for each year, from 2000 to 2023, for 270 UK cities.
Its format is the following:

CITY | 2001 | 2002 | ... | 2023 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
City 0 | x rainy days | y rainy days | ... | z rainy days |
City 1 | x rainy days | y rainy days | ... | z rainy days |
... | ... | ... | ... | ...
City 270 | x rainy days | y rainy days | ... | z rainy days |

2. rain_40_cities.txt

A text file in the same format as "rain_AVG_city.txt", produced by the second Jupyter Notebook (Automation), containing the rain information for the first 40 cities (out of the 270).


3. City_coords.txt

A text file, containing the Latitude and Longitude of every city, in decimals. This file is generated by the 2nd Notebook (Automation) and it is of the format:

Link | Latitude | Longitude |
---  | --- | ---
City 0 | 51.5083 | -0.1256|
City 1 | x Latitude | y Longitude |
... | ... | ...
City 300 | x Latitude | y Longitude |

### Interactive geospatial plot

"yearly_rain"

An animated plot (gif), of the UK map, indicating the cities, for which we calculated the number of rainy days per year. Each snapshot corresponds to one year, from 2001 up to 2023. The colour of the scatter points corresponds to the amount of rainy days for that year. This plot is generated by the 3rd Notebook (Colourmaps and animated plots).
